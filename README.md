# Portfolio

This is my portfolio made with <3 using reactjs and gatsby.


### Personalization

Edit `config.js` to put up your details

### Deploying using Github page

`package.json` has a default script that uses `gh-pages` module to publish on Github pages. Simply running `npm run deploy` would publish the site on github pages.


### Acknowledgments
